### Create an account secret
Go to `App Settings` > `Create new client secret`. You should see a long string. Store this info as described below. 


### Store this info

You should save your Tink credentials now. You will need both the client ID and the client secret. Create a file and call it `.env`. Your file should look like this:

```

```

No spaces between the equal signs!!!
